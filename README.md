# Generalised-Data-Structures-Library
This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.  We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear  data strutters in an object oriented way. All the object oriented design policies are used in this project
